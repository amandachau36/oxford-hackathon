# Oxford Global Hackathon

**14-15 Sept 2019, Sydney**

We entered the  as a team of UX designers and software engineer graduates from General Assembly. The challenge: how can Oxford create a system or process to ensure specified materials are fairly-priced while factoring in market perceptions of quality? We collaborated together to create the Oxford Procurement Marketplace - a reverse bidding system for building materials where buyers can review quality, easily compare bids, and monitor their budget all in one place!
